# Space Apps 2018 - The Oblate Spheroids

This project is a **work in progress** and was developed during and for the Space Apps hackathon.

When selecting data to graph, select a data file under "<root directory>/data/OUTPUT/<Compound>/<Year>.csv". Do not select files from "data/CSV" as they are unprocessed. We plan on updating the file selection system as this system is not user friendly.

Data is still missing as there was not enough time during the hackathon to download the entire database. Please expect some compound-year datafiles to be missing, and within a compound-year datafile to have missing data.

This project graphs the relative measurements from the Canada's SCISAT on a globe (measurements are averaged across altitude in this version).

The point of this project is to help the general public visualize SCISAT's data.

Tested browsers:
-Ran on Firefox and Edge
-Did not run on Chrome and Explored (likely a problem with OpenGL target)
