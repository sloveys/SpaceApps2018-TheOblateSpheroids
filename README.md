# Space Apps 2018 - The Oblate Spheroids

This project is a **work in progress** and was developed during and for the Space Apps hackathon. 

Data is still missing as there was not enough time during the hackathon to download the entire database. Please expect some compund-year datafiles to be missing, and within a compund-year datafile to have missing data.

This project graphs the relative measurments from the Canada's SCISAT on a globe (measurments are averaged accross altitude in this version).

The point of this project is to help the general public visualize SCISAT's data.
